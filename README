rip a disassembled .so file for DBC data
to use with SavvyCAN

usage:
cp dbcheader exapmle.dbc
python ripdbc.py exapmle.so.asm >> exapmle.dbc

then you can load exapmle.dbc in SavvyCAN and see the named CAN IDs

BUG:
SavvyCAN displays the message IDs improperly until you click on them to expand.
this is a bug in SavvyCAN not in ripdbc.py
